# :: HSDropout ::
 
The idea of this plugin is to create an effect where the left and right channel of the signal is dropping in and out like a bad connection. The Rate affects the probability of a signal loss in each channel, the Size affects the length of the dropout, and the Depth affects how far the signal drops out. 
Even when the Left and Right channel parameters are equal, the signal still will always be in stereo.
